//Employee and ProductionWorker Classes Design an Employee class that has fields for the following pieces of information: 
//l Employee name 
//l Employee number
//Next, design a class named ProductionWorker that extends the Employee class. 
//The ProductionWorker class should have fields to hold the following information: 
//l Shift number (an integer, such as 1, 2, or 3) 
//l Hourly pay rate

//The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. 
//The shift field will hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. 
//The day shift is shift 1 and the night shift is shift 2. 
//Design the appropriate accessor/getter and mutator/setter methods for each class.
//Once you have designed the classes, design a program that creates an object of the ProductionWorker class 
//and prompts the user to enter data for each of the object’s fields. 
//Store the data in the object and then use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve it and display it on the screen.
